      <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/jrui/sketches/bDa5IjcbT">click to see</a>
      <h5>This is a music player. It comes with built-in music, and you can switch tracks by clicking the left and right arrows. I've incorporated background music and natural sounds, allowing this player to provide audio accompaniment for users' daily lives. The clever part of this program lies in its structure, which enables users to modify the Preload section without needing to look at the backend code. By simply uploading the music file and its corresponding image, then creating a new sound class and adding it to the Array, the program can automatically include this new music and generate a dedicated playback page for it. The order of music playback follows the sequence of the Array.</h5>
      <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vkqFfOoVr9qaG09n_QKhVeN2yWwF9qwujNLq2o8MeqA/edit?usp=sharing">3 project ideas</a><br />
      <a href="project-2/project-2-1/index.html">project-2 pre exercise</a>
      <h5>This is my first time building a complete webpage. HTML feels quite different from the languages I've learned before—it seems more like a language humans would speak. It's really interesting. For this project, I basically just randomly added whatever came to mind and did a little formatting. Since the theme is FUN, I made the page colorful and added some fun GIFs.</h5>
      <a href="project-2/project-2-travelWorldWithBWheel/index.html">project-2</a><br />
      <h5>This is my project 2. Essentially, it allows the whale to take you to different places around the world based on various clicks, enabling you to travel the globe. The website features relaxing music and cute whale emoticons, and I want users to feel very relaxed while using it. Originally, I had the idea to incorporate AI for real-time generation, rather than pre-generating content before adding it. However, after nearly a week of attempts, I found it quite complex. Additionally, integrating AI made the entire process feel somewhat uncontrollable, and the AI itself was complicated—I couldn’t fully align it with my desired style. So, I ended up removing that part. Perhaps in the future, when I have more time, I’ll try again. Overall, I think the design of this website is quite interesting. Aside from the AI part, another regret is not incorporating more JavaScript. I’m thinking about where I could add it, and maybe next time I’ll try to include more JS. Also, regarding the backgrounds, they were all generated by AI using the same prompt, so they were meant to be as stylistically consistent as possible. Unfortunately, the AI service I used was shut down when I was working on the fourth background. The first three backgrounds turned out really beautiful, but two of them don’t quite match the earlier style. Still, I thought they looked pretty good as they were, so I didn’t make any changes.</h5>
