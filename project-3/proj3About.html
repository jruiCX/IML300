<div class="subtitle2" id="about">
    <strong>Tell Me a Secret</strong> is an immersive digital sanctuary designed to explore the profound weight and intrigue of the things we keep hidden. Inspired by the visual storytelling of Pinterest, this project creates an anonymous space where users can release their unspoken thoughts, confessions, or whispers of encouragement.
    <br>
    <strong>Why does this exist?</strong> Because silence can be heavy. In a society often obsessed with curated perfection and identifiable status, true vulnerability is rare. This platform is important because it offers catharsis; it validates the universal human experience that everyone carries something unseen. It is built for anyone carrying the weight of unsaid words—from the lonely to the hopeful—who seeks connection without the constraints of identity.
    <br>
    <strong>Socially</strong>, this project responds to the increasing isolation of the digital age and the performance of self-identity. By removing names and faces, we dismantle the biases that usually filter our empathy. It creates an equitable ground for emotional expression, challenging the stigma that vulnerability is a weakness. Here, a stranger’s secret becomes a mirror to our own humanity, fostering a unique form of nameless solidarity.
