                <h2>Project Concept</h2>
                <p id="dis">This is my project. Essentially, it allows the whale to take you to different places around the world based on various clicks, enabling you to travel the globe. The website features relaxing music and cute whale emoticons, and I want users to feel very relaxed while using it. Originally, I had the idea to incorporate AI for real-time generation, rather than pre-generating content before adding it. However, after nearly a week of attempts, I found it quite complex. Additionally, integrating AI made the entire process feel somewhat uncontrollable, and the AI itself was complicated—I couldn’t fully align it with my desired style. So, I ended up removing that part. Perhaps in the future, when I have more time, I’ll try again. Overall, I think the design of this website is quite interesting. Aside from the AI part, another regret is not incorporating more JavaScript. I’m thinking about where I could add it, and maybe next time I’ll try to include more JS.
Also, regarding the backgrounds, they were all generated by AI using the same prompt, so they were meant to be as stylistically consistent as possible. Unfortunately, the AI service I used was shut down when I was working on the fourth background. The first three backgrounds turned out really beautiful, but two of them don’t quite match the earlier style. Still, I thought they looked pretty good as they were, so I didn’t make any changes.</p>
